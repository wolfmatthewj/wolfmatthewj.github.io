   Natural resources are similar to agriculture.<br/>
   Illinois has a lot of it too.<br/>
  Here's some.
     </p>
  <p>
   So let's go!<br/>
 <div class="Landforms">
     <h3>1. Underground</h3><ul><li><h4>Coal</h4>There is an estimated 200 billion tons of this rocky material under the Praire state. It is also helpful, but it's uses are dying out. It only really is for generating electricity and power.</li><li><h4>Oil</h4>Illinois produces 642,000 liters of this substance a year! It is used for mostly the same purposes as coal: making electricity.</li>

     <p><h3>2. Animals</h3><ul><li><h4>Racoon</h4> There are about 2,606,175 of these in Illinois. These creatures are native to the U.S. and all over.
