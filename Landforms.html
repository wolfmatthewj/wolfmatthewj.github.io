   Illinois has many different landforms.<br/>
   From hills to lakes to forests, they're all over!<br/>
   Here are some more specific ones.
  </p>
  <p>
   So let's go!<br/>
 <div class="Landforms">
 <p class="Cmounds"><h3>1. Cahokia Mounds</h3>The Cahokia mounds are large hill-like mases near Collinsville, IL. They are very big, stretching out for 2,200 acres. The mounds are manmade, created by the Missipians.The Missipians were a group who made the mounds arond the late 1200s. These hills were an important part of culture for them. Monks mound is the biggest, at 100 feet tall. Another popular mound is Mound 72, that was for burial. <br/>
     <h4>A little history</h4><br/>The site is a Pre-columbiann Native american city. It was basically <em>the</em> city! But in about 1300, it was abandoned. Scientest have found many tools and other items on this site.<p><br/>

     <p><h3>2.Missisipi River</h3><br/> As the longest river in the U.S., the Missisipi river is pretty great. The source of it is Lake Lasca, in Minnesota. It flows through Wisconsin, Iowa, Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas, Michigan, and of course Illinois. It ends down in the Gulf of Mexaco. The biggest city on it is Memphis, TN. Also, it streches 2,320 miles long! This nataral stretch of water is very useful. It is used to move producs up and down the height of the U.S. But watch out! River sharks <em>have</em> been seen in there! </p><br/>

     <p><h3>3.Charles Mound</h3><br/>As having the tallest point in the IL, Charles Mound is very popular. It is even technically a mountain! The height of it is a wopping 1,235 feet high. It is in The Jo Daviess county, by Galena. There is a reason why it is high compared to the rest of the flat Illinois. This is thet it's in the Driftless area, a area that was not struck by glaciers. It is named after Eilija Charles, who was on farmland there in 1828. Because of all this, it is a very popular tourist location.

    <p><h3>4.Lake Michigan</h3>This large body of water is great. Maybe that's why It's one of the great lakes! It was formed many years ago by glaciers. It is 307x118 Miles big, and 923 ft deep.(At it's lowest point) The shore lenth is 1,400 miles!. You can go swimming or boating in it. You could also fish on it's long shore. It is also the main source of water for Chicago. Acculy, that city uses tons of it for all it's purposes.</p><br/>
