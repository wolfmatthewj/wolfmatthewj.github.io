  </p>
  <p>
      So let's go! <br/> </p>
						<ul><li><h3>Foods</h3><br/>There are many foods eaten in Illinois, especially in Chicago. Some people even come to Chicago just for it's food!<br/><br/><h4>Chicago-style hot dog</h4>Possable ingredients: Beef, Poppy seed buns, Mustard, Onions, Sweet pickle relish, Peppers, tomatoes, and/or Pickle spears. <br/>About: Many people in Chicago think ketchup is "Unacceptable". It is very popular in fairs and baseball games. As time went on, they got more and more popular. Some popular restrants/food stands that sell them are: Fruky's, Gene and Jude's, Hot Doug's, Portillo's and Superdawg's.<h4>Chicago-style Pizza</h3>Possable ingredients: Pizza dough, tomato sause, and/or cheese. Possable toppings: Pepperoni or Italian sauceage.<br/><br/>Pizza has always been popular in Chicago, but it wasn't intil the 1970s they were thick. It is sold at Nancy Pitza's and Giardano's.<br/><h4>Maxwell street Poish</h4>Possable ingredients: Bun, kielgasa, onions, and mustard.<br/>This dish was created by Jimmy Steffancuie. He took his aunt and uncle's hot dog stand in 1939. The stand was located on Maxwell street. This meal is a lot like a sandwitch, and is very popular. But there were now 2 stands, and they were competing. But then the University of Chicago bought the land, and they had to move. So they relocated and started all over. Now the street is very Historic.<br/>	<br/><img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR9Tv0c0GyZ3UZOKhWhXlhqZZjDgCyE_ddW4Z6dkqizINM6BVpXOOavpQhDNzxhjWK8DoM:https://giordanos.com/wp-content/uploads/Hero-image_1210-v2.jpg&usqp=CAU"></li>
						<li><h3>The Illinois State Fair</h3><br/> The Illinois State Fair is one of the many fun and great state fairs. It happens every august annually, in Springfield. The time it was created was 1853. At the beginning, it was mainly just Farmers comparing notes. It moved from 1853-92. By 1894, it was in Springfield. Then in 1895, a Dome building was bought for $69,000 from Chicago. The diameter was 222 feet! It held 10,000. But there was a fire in 1917, and it collapsed.<br/><br/>There was no fair from 1942-45, due to a Air force supply depot being held on the grounds. After world war one, there came more and more entertanment. After 2012, the attendance droped. In 2013 it was 961,143. But in 2018,it was 369,144. This reversed in 2019, haveing 509,000 people.<br/><br/>Now there is the count is 100 just for buildings! That isn't counting the tons of pavillians and trailers. The Illinois state fair is an excellent place to go for fun and excitement.</li>
