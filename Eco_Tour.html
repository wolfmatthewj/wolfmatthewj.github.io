	Here are 2 examples of these.
  </p>
  <p>
      So let's go! <br/> </p>
						<ul><li><h3>Galena</h3><br/>Galana is a famous town in the Jo Daviss country. It is very historic, which brings tourists to it. This town is nanmed for galena, a minaral that was always mined there.  This means a great economy, even rivaling Chicago at a point! It is famous for being the home of Ulysses S. Grant, one of the presadents of the U.S. <br/><br/><h4>History</h4>French setterlers started coming in 1690. Most people mined the much galena. The Julien Dubuque mines opened in 1788. More mines went up, and the econamy exploaded. The town was named Galena after a survay in 1826. <br/><br/>21 milllinon pounds of lead were mined from 1825-1828. That year, the population went up to 10,000! In 1830, they created a fire depot, the trustees and mayor, the town seal, and an alderman. Then in 1845, they mined 27,000 <em>tons</em> Of lead!<br/><br/>But from the mid-19th centery to the 2000s, the econamy fell. This was because the lead demand went down. The population went from 14,000 in around 1850 to 3,396 at 2000. It's current population is 3,429. The area of the town is 4.17  sq miles. The mayor is Terrence Renner. It has an elevation of 633 feet.<br/><br/>Even though it's econamy has fallen, Galena is a very popular tourist location due to it's history. There is a Country fair in Grant park. Another place to visit is Horseshoe mound. It is 246 feet tall. This is because Galena is in the Driftless zone.<br/><br/>Galena is a great plase to go to see some wonders of nature.</li>
						<li><h3>The Willis Tower</h3><br/>The Willis tower is easily the biggest building in Illinois. It stands high in Chicago. This build towers at 1,729 feet tall, with 110 stories. It was even the tallest building in the world from 1972-96'!<br/><br/>The Willis group owns it. It used to be called the Sears tower. Originally, it was built for the Sears and Poebuck  company. It was built from 1970-73' (3 years!) The idea for the architecture was a ciggerete box. The designers were Fazlar Khan and Bruse Graham. It cost $150 million. The fire sprinklers alone cost $4 million!<br/><br/>On the 103rd floor there is a famous skydeck. On it you can feel the building move and see Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Michagan. It has retractable glass balconies.<br/><br/>It also has one of the fastest elevaters in the world. You can feel the air change in it. It goes 1,600fpm (feet per min)	It is now the 2nd tallest building in the U.S, and the 8th in the world. The biggest floors are 55,000 sq feet.</li>
